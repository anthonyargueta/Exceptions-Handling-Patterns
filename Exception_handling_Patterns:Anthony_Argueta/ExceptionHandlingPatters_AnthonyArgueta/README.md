# Exception Handling Patters in Python, Ruby, and Java
### Gabriel Mendoza & Anthony Argueta

## Overview 
This projects demonstrates exception handling concepts exactly as presented in our class slides:

- Exception: an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program
- Throwing / Raising exceptions 
- Catching exceptions using try-catch constructs
- Using finally/ensure clauses for cleanup
- Exception propagation through the call stack 

- In three languages python, ruby, java 
- exception models
- error handling styles
- cleanup mechanisms
- propagation behavior 
- checked vs unchecked exceptions
